# MC-Bulk-Name-Checker
(this is my very first time uploading something to github so I don't know what i'm doing at all)

Very simple python script. Opens a terminal in which you can check the availability of minecraft usernames in bulk. 
A version featuring an actual UI may come out at some point. (if I ever figure out how to not make it hideous)



If you experience any issues, have any questions or feedback for this tool, please message me on discord. @ vichonder
