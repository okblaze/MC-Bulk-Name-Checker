# MC-Bulk-Name-Checker
(this is my very first time uploading something to github so I don't know what i'm doing at all)
Very simple python script. Opens a terminal in which you can check the availability of minecraft usernames in bulk. An UI version may come out at some point.


Files containing usernames should use this format:

username

username

username
